Eve.NET Testbed
===============

An [Eve][1] instance running out there in the wild so [Eve.NET][2] developers
can run their tests against it. 

You can clone this repo and run the instance locally (highly reccomended; needs
a working Python environment - see Eve documentation) or you can opt to consume
the free testbed instance available at http://evenet-testbed.herokuapp.com
(will be slow and please, don't abuse it). 

Eve and Eve.NET are [Nicola Iarocci][3] and [Gestionali Amica][4] open source
projects, distributed under the [BSD license][5]
